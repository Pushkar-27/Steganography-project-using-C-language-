# Steganography-project-using-C-language-
This project implements Image Steganography using the Least Significant Bit (LSB) method in C. It hides a secret message inside an uncompressed BMP image without visible changes. The system supports encoding text into pixel data and decoding it back using bit-level manipulation.
